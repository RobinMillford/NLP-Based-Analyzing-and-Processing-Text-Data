In present several AI projects are helping in diagnosing diseases better match up drugs with people depending on what theyre sick they can get treated better so its going to help a whole lot of people get treated and get better #healthcare than would have had access to it before if you look at self-driving cars theyre going to be safer than people driving cars and the value that machine learning is providing is actually happening beneath the surface and it is things like improved search results improved product recommendations for customers improve forecasting for inventory management and literally hundreds of other things including speech-recognition or image-recognition that the performance levels are phenomenal or drug discovery as these biological systems are very complicated because vaccines for TB and HIV developing thats notably enabled by this rich data advanced in biology and machine learning and recent invention in which is an application we just launched for anybody with visual impairment ass it uses the latest cutting-edge computer vision technology to give anyone the ability to see so anyone who has dyslexia can now use AI to be able to read better and with the latest release of Windows 10 has this capability called IJs which enable the eye muscle that the gaze can help to type,15,2,0.7647058373702448,0.07870370333933471,216,23.61111111111111,533.8444444444444,216,61,216,414,1,5.078703703703703
Like the two sides of the coin there are negative impacts of AI as well Bill Gates Ellen Musk also tech giants in a way their views are pessimistic to say the least they warned against the potential of AI to replace humans in the workplace and Ella masks even went as far as to claim that AI is the biggest existential threat to mankind,2,4,-0.33333327777778704,0.09230769088757398,65,10.76923076923077,138.70769230769233,65,7,65,109,0,4.184615384615385
because of the loss of a job when you think about a job or a career choice if a majority of the tasks that comprise that career choice is likely to be these vulnerable tasks then that is a career at risk in the future so what are the tasks that AI will find,0,3,-0.9999996666667778,0.05555555452674899,54,20.37037037037037,110.94814814814816,54,11,54,83,0,3.7777777777777777
hard to do anything unpredictable anything that requires skills like creative thinking or empathy or interpersonal skills but its important to understand tomorrow whether Google is there or not artificial intelligence is going to progress you know technology has just nature its that its going to evolve as technology and in particular AI can in fact bring more empowerment more inclusiveness and at the same time it is important to be clear-eyed about displacement and unintended consequences like any other technology and work both skills so that people can find the jobs of the future create new jobs also the policy decisions that help people as they go through this change people already unhappy because of machine learning artificial intelligence as they think if theyre not innovative enough or not creative enough your job will be taking away by a lot of machines AI for business going to affect the future of work specifically there are jobs that are at more risk of being taken over by AI and automation there is very wide dissonance on this there are different reports that have been shared by Oxford study that says 47% of US jobs are at risk of automation over the next few years meanwhile the general population and workers think differently a recent study conducted by college actually identifies that 97% of workers believe that most jobs will be automated but not their own this suggests that the general public needs to be educated on which jobs are susceptible to this risk which are not and businesses need to be aware of the forthcoming skills gap of course not all jobs are equal the Oxford study that highlights this they examined 700 participants and found the generalist occupations that require creative knowledge or innovation are at least risk the same is true for occupations in education healthcare media and arts jobs on the flip side jobs like telemarketers junior lawyers accountants are at most risk in short there is a simple rule of thumb if your job is in some way predictable or routine the risk of automation is much higher if a job doesnt require innovation or creativity then the return on investment for companies is higher on machines than real-time employees machines are faster cant be distracted and can work 24/7 this is actually good for creative marketers because AI and automation can serve to augment their jobs rather than substituting them as impact of emerging technologies on the creative economy they stated that artificial intelligence is changing creative content from beginning to end by 2030 AI will be able to write high school essays code in Python composed top 40s chart songs and make creative videos but all of these advancements also come with risks and costs take a look at this report by the global Commission on the future of work in the absence of effective transition policies many people will have to accept lower skilled and lower paying jobs high-skilled workers are taking less cognitively demanding jobs displacing less educated workers and this is already happening also technological dividends are being unevenly distributed among firms a very limited amount of companies tend to dominate when it comes to big data just think about Google and Facebook today they alone are responsible for 70% of the referral marketing traffic and receive more than 50% of total global advertising budget so the question is in businesses workers and social institutions go into the same direction if companies and public policy leaders can understand the evolving landscape they can help the workforce anticipate the upcoming challenges technology and the demographic changes are leading to a smaller workforce compared to the previous generation and a workforce that has to pursue many careers during their time of work we need to provide workers with an environment where they can continuously upskill and grow governments will have to re-evaluate the educational system we will have to continuously learn and grow and companies will have to redesign their structure and their culture around technology just like during the Industrial Revolution we are heading into a new age and the great transformation that were about to see by 2022 it is estimated that 20 to 25 percent of the labor force will be displaced within 10 to 20 years however this is also an opportunity for people to get ahead for which different ways have to be find to attract and retain highly skilled workers and allow them the time to up skill themselves even during work hours and it is a good way to develop a learning community to benefit from each other and also to use technology to supplement goal tracking and efforts instead of as a distraction in short what we are doing is to bridge the dissonance and it is imperative to build a map of how AI and automation will affect industry and company if this is an economic imperative how do people feel about committing itself to a lifelong approach to knowledge as these risks are important but it is important to do things like from being upfront to have ethical charters like AI safety and to be very transparent and open and how we perceive progress there and figure out global frameworks by which we can engage just like Paris agreement and climate change by using such forums bring people together as they engage on the hard questions and it will emerge answers and on the question of whether AI is a threat or not artificial intelligence is not a threat because there is a rare case where people need to be proactive in regulation instead of reactive because I think by the time we are reactive in AI regulation its too late right now we have machine learning algorithms that can solve an incredibly complex problem beyond any human intelligence as they are mere machines that can be given enormous data set and they come up with brilliant correlations and insights but theyre not going threaten the human population anytime soon because fish intelligent isnt terrible but human being a smart enough to learn that skills at least to have a complete toolbox to be prepared volatility of the future

The question remains how EVA made allocations It was found that statistically only the origin country and the city were significant factors for screening,1,0,0.9999990000010001,0.041666664930555625,24,29.166666666666668,72.86666666666666,24,7,24,49,0,5.416666666666667
Ultimately from a variety of countries and city pairs EVA had to predict how many testing resources were to be allocated at each entry point and to particular passengers from a location is technically called the Multi-Armed Bandit MAB problem and the chosen method to solve this problem was an AI algorithm called optimistic Gittins index,2,2,0.0,0.07142857015306125,56,14.285714285714285,140.9142857142857,56,12,56,106,0,5.053571428571429

Following the collection of significant data through the aforementioned process after a certain period policies were made categorizing them separately and imposing restrictions on travelers from the specific location,1,1,0.0,0.06896551486325811,29,41.37931034482759,102.95172413793102,29,14,29,75,0,6.482758620689655

Data is the new oil has become the most important trendline of the 21st century,1,0,0.9999990000010001,0.06666666222222252,15,20.0,39.6,15,3,15,23,0,4.333333333333333
The reason for this is the advancements in the fields related to data analysis,0,0,0.0,0.0,14,21.428571428571427,39.77142857142857,14,4,14,25,0,4.642857142857143
The field of AI Machine Learning Statistics and Data Mining all deal with data and are developing at such a staggering pace that these fields have become the most popular buzzwords these days,1,0,0.9999990000010001,0.030303029384756687,33,21.21212121212121,84.88484848484849,33,7,33,61,0,4.818181818181818
Buzzwords are originated through technical terms but often the underlying essence is ignored through fashionable use and mainly used to impress,2,0,0.99999950000025,0.09523809070294806,21,19.047619047619047,64.81904761904762,21,6,21,46,0,5.857142857142857
This is the main reason for the misconception amongst people,0,1,-0.9999990000010001,0.09999999000000101,10,30.0,36.0,10,3,10,20,0,5.1
AI ML Stats Data Mining and many other fields related to the analysis of data are most often mistook for one and the same thing thus all these words are often used interchangeably to convey one and the same thing,0,0,0.0,0.0,40,7.5,87.80000000000001,40,4,40,66,0,4.325
But this is not true at all,0,0,0.0,0.0,7,0.0,10.8,7,0,7,8,0,3.0
The only similarity between these disciplines is that all of these disciplines are related to the analysis of the data and converting this data into information,0,0,0.0,0.0,26,19.230769230769234,71.6923076923077,26,8,26,53,0,5.1923076923076925
In academics while learning AI Machine Learning Statistics and Data Mining the academic approach only wander in the technical definitions and concepts but the underlying essence and the aim of the discipline remain unexplored same is the case with most of the articles out there which try to explain the difference,0,0,0.0,0.0,51,29.411764705882355,137.36470588235295,51,17,51,102,0,5.176470588235294
Thus becoming the primary cause of confusion between learners,0,1,-0.9999990000010001,0.11111109876543349,9,55.55555555555556,46.62222222222223,9,5,9,21,0,5.888888888888889
Hence this article explains the difference by explaining the philosophy and the aims of each of the disciplines rather than wandering in the technical definitions,0,0,0.0,0.0,25,32.0,77.60000000000001,25,9,25,51,0,5.52
Then what is the difference between AI Machine Learning Statistics and Data Mining,0,0,0.0,0.0,13,38.46153846153847,48.18461538461539,13,5,13,27,0,5.384615384615385
The essential difference between these disciplines lies in their aims and the approach taken to achieve those aims,0,1,-0.9999990000010001,0.055555552469135974,18,27.77777777777778,56.71111111111111,18,6,18,41,0,5.388888888888889
The aims of each of these fields are explained in detail in the following sections Artificial Intelligence The aim of Artificial intelligence is to understand intelligent entities,3,0,0.9999996666667778,0.11111110699588492,27,33.33333333333333,84.93333333333334,27,11,27,66,0,5.666666666666667
Then to satisfy this aim we must first understand what is intelligence and what makes an agent intelligent agent,3,0,0.9999996666667778,0.15789472853185638,19,15.789473684210526,51.11578947368421,19,3,19,33,1,4.947368421052632
The answer to all these questions can be found by studying intelligent agents and the best example of an intelligent agent can be found by just standing in front of a mirror,3,0,0.9999996666667778,0.0937499970703126,32,12.5,74.2,32,4,32,50,0,4.4375
Yes,0,0,0.0,0.0,1,0.0,1.2000000000000002,1,0,1,1,0,3.0
Humans are the best examples of intelligent entities,2,0,0.99999950000025,0.24999996875000394,8,12.5,25.8,8,3,8,18,0,5.625
Thus in the 1900s researchers began exploring the thought process the reasoning process of humans as human beings were considered as an ideal intelligent agent,2,0,0.99999950000025,0.07999999680000013,25,20.0,71.60000000000001,25,6,25,49,0,5.4
Mimicking human behavior became the aim of AI in the initial years of the research,0,0,0.0,0.0,15,33.33333333333333,46.13333333333333,15,5,15,31,0,4.533333333333333
After setting this goal studies and experiments began and the most famous experiment conducted in the initial years to achieve this aim was the Turing Test,1,0,0.9999990000010001,0.03846153698224858,26,19.230769230769234,69.6923076923077,26,7,26,51,0,5.0
Turing defined intelligent behavior as the ability to achieve human-level performance in all cognitive tasks sufficient to fool an interrogator,2,1,0.33333322222225925,0.14999999250000037,20,45.0,75.2,20,10,20,51,0,6.2
But this test received criticism as only mimicking human behavior is not exactly intelligence,1,1,0.0,0.14285713265306196,14,28.57142857142857,48.62857142857143,14,5,14,30,0,5.714285714285714
Because intelligence should be related to the working of the human brain as without the human brain intelligence has no meaning,2,0,0.99999950000025,0.09523809070294806,21,23.809523809523807,60.32380952380952,21,6,21,44,0,5.095238095238095
Thus mimicking human thought processes and reasoning became the transformed aim,0,0,0.0,0.0,11,27.27272727272727,42.50909090909091,11,5,11,25,0,6.2727272727272725
The field of Psychology and philosophy also resonate with this aim that is to understand the human thought process,0,0,0.0,0.0,19,15.789473684210526,51.915789473684214,19,3,19,33,0,5.052631578947368
The difference is that AI not only tries to understand the thought process but to mimic it build it,0,0,0.0,0.0,19,10.526315789473683,43.810526315789474,19,2,19,30,0,4.2631578947368425
The collaboration of these fields resulted in models such as Neural Networks which try to mimic the function of neurons present in the human brain,0,0,0.0,0.0,25,16.0,64.8,25,5,25,45,0,4.88
So basically this initial aim was human-centered and humans were considered as the ideal intelligent agent,2,0,0.99999950000025,0.12499999218750048,16,25.0,52.400000000000006,16,6,16,37,0,5.6875
Concurrently the field of computer science was developing at a greater pace,0,0,0.0,0.0,12,41.66666666666667,46.66666666666667,12,5,12,25,0,5.333333333333333
With the advances in computer science the experiments and theories could be easily tested and validated,0,0,0.0,0.0,16,25.0,51.2,16,7,16,35,0,5.5
As programs were being applied to solve real-life problems it was found that computers performed better than humans at some tasks that are really complex for humans,1,2,-0.33333322222225925,0.11111110699588492,27,7.4074074074074066,68.56296296296297,27,4,27,49,0,5.111111111111111
One of the best examples of this could be the chess-playing program,1,0,0.9999990000010001,0.08333332638888948,12,8.333333333333332,30.133333333333333,12,2,12,19,0,4.666666666666667
An AI program defeated the worlds best chess player Garry Kasparov,2,0,0.99999950000025,0.1818181652892577,11,9.090909090909092,30.03636363636364,11,2,11,19,0,5.090909090909091
This incident indicated that human intelligence is not the ultimate intelligence or else a human would have been able to defeat the AI program,3,0,0.9999996666667778,0.12499999479166687,24,20.833333333333336,65.13333333333334,24,6,24,51,0,4.958333333333333
This leads to a question is human intelligence the ideal intelligence,4,0,0.9999997500000625,0.3636363305785154,11,36.36363636363637,42.145454545454555,11,4,11,26,0,5.363636363636363
As computers became more advanced they proved to be better than humans at certain complex tasks,2,1,0.33333322222225925,0.18749998828125072,16,18.75,45.5,16,4,16,29,0,5.0
That is why the new definition of intelligence was being related to the ability to solve cognitive tasks or problems,1,1,0.0,0.09999999500000024,20,20.0,54.400000000000006,20,5,20,37,0,4.85
So rather than considering the nature of agents researchers began to study the nature of intelligence itself,1,0,0.9999990000010001,0.05882352595155729,17,29.411764705882355,54.964705882352945,17,5,17,35,0,5.411764705882353
Then the question comes how to test or validate intelligence,1,0,0.9999990000010001,0.09999999000000101,10,30.0,36.0,10,3,10,21,0,5.1
The best way to test intelligence is to solve cognitive problems,2,1,0.33333322222225925,0.2727272479338866,11,18.181818181818183,32.872727272727275,11,2,11,20,0,4.909090909090909
An agent can be said intelligent only if it can solve a complex problem,1,2,-0.33333322222225925,0.21428569897959293,14,7.142857142857142,31.257142857142856,14,1,14,22,0,4.142857142857143
The problem-solving approach can be easily tested and validated on computers,0,0,0.0,0.0,11,36.36363636363637,44.94545454545455,11,5,11,24,0,6.0
Thus some researchers began studying the ideal intelligence and the selected agent to validate the experiments was the computer,2,0,0.99999950000025,0.10526315235457093,19,31.57894736842105,63.43157894736842,19,7,19,42,0,5.7368421052631575
So a computer and problem-solving approach were adopted,0,0,0.0,0.0,8,37.5,37.0,8,4,8,18,0,6.0
So the human-centered approach and computer problem-solving approach are the two main aims of AI,0,0,0.0,0.0,15,26.666666666666668,49.06666666666667,15,5,15,32,0,5.466666666666667
Both of these fields have contributed to the field by giving valuable insights,1,0,0.9999990000010001,0.07692307100591762,13,7.6923076923076925,34.276923076923076,13,2,13,24,0,5.076923076923077
Both the aims are important and both of these collaboratively form the main aim of AI,1,0,0.9999990000010001,0.06249999609375024,16,12.5,39.0,16,2,16,29,0,4.375
Machine Learning In the problem-solving approach there is a big challenge that AI has to overcome in order to achieve its aim,0,0,0.0,0.0,22,31.818181818181817,62.72727272727273,22,7,22,43,0,4.7272727272727275
Consider the example of solving a math problem,0,1,-0.9999990000010001,0.12499998437500197,8,25.0,28.400000000000002,8,2,8,14,0,4.875
There are two cases by which intelligence can be tested in this problem-solving approach,1,0,0.9999990000010001,0.07142856632653098,14,21.428571428571427,43.77142857142857,14,3,14,26,0,5.357142857142857
Let us say two math problems are given for you to solve,0,1,-0.9999990000010001,0.08333332638888948,12,0.0,22.0,12,0,12,17,1,3.6666666666666665
The first problem is familiar to you and the second problem is not,0,2,-0.99999950000025,0.15384614201183525,13,7.6923076923076925,29.47692307692308,13,1,13,20,0,4.153846153846154
Consider the first problem,0,1,-0.9999990000010001,0.24999993750001562,4,25.0,20.400000000000002,4,1,4,7,0,5.75
The first problem is familiar to you that means you know how to solve such kind of problems as you have already solved some similar problems in the past,0,3,-0.9999996666667778,0.10344827229488716,29,10.344827586206897,64.93793103448276,29,3,29,47,0,4.275862068965517
So there comes a question how our mind is able to solve that problem,0,1,-0.9999990000010001,0.07142856632653098,14,7.142857142857142,30.057142857142857,14,1,14,23,1,3.9285714285714284
The answer is that you have solved similar problems in the past thus you have learned from the past data how to solve such problems thus even if you havent seen that problem in the past you will still be able to solve similar problems,0,4,-0.9999997500000625,0.0888888869135803,45,4.444444444444445,95.3777777777778,45,3,45,70,0,4.222222222222222
This is one form of intelligence,1,0,0.9999990000010001,0.16666663888889352,6,16.666666666666664,19.46666666666667,6,1,6,11,0,4.5
Consider another case where you are given a second problem where you have not solved such kind of problems in the past,0,2,-0.99999950000025,0.09090908677685969,22,9.090909090909092,50.83636363636364,22,2,22,38,0,4.409090909090909
Then to solve this problem you will try to consciously gather and manipulate the given information so that you reach a certain conclusion,0,2,-0.99999950000025,0.08695651795841226,23,21.73913043478261,63.49565217391305,23,5,23,45,0,5.0
This kind of approach does not necessarily rely on the past data but completely on the reasoning process,0,0,0.0,0.0,18,22.22222222222222,50.488888888888894,18,4,18,31,0,4.833333333333333
This is the second kind of intelligence,1,0,0.9999990000010001,0.1428571224489825,7,14.285714285714285,21.314285714285717,7,1,7,12,0,4.714285714285714
For AI to build intelligent agents both of these kinds of intelligence must be developed in the agent,2,0,0.99999950000025,0.11111110493827195,18,11.11111111111111,44.84444444444445,18,3,18,33,0,4.666666666666667
But the reality is that AI has reached the point where it is able to build agents which can only learn from past data and find some useful information,1,0,0.9999990000010001,0.034482757431629055,29,10.344827586206897,64.13793103448276,29,4,29,48,0,4.206896551724138
AI today has not reached a point where it can build agents who can think on their own,0,0,0.0,0.0,18,0.0,34.0,18,1,18,27,0,3.7777777777777777
That is the second type of intelligence,1,0,0.9999990000010001,0.1428571224489825,7,14.285714285714285,21.314285714285717,7,1,7,12,0,4.714285714285714
So the way AI is able to implement the first type of intelligence is through Machine Learning,1,0,0.9999990000010001,0.05882352595155729,17,23.52941176470588,46.61176470588236,17,4,17,30,0,4.529411764705882
So the domain of AI which focuses solely on implementing the first kind of intelligence is in fact Machine Learning,1,0,0.9999990000010001,0.04999999750000012,20,25.0,56.0,20,6,20,37,0,4.8
That is the reason why ML is called the subset of AI,0,0,0.0,0.0,12,8.333333333333332,24.133333333333333,12,1,12,15,0,3.4166666666666665
So this is the main difference between AI and ML,0,0,0.0,0.0,10,20.0,27.200000000000003,10,2,10,16,0,3.9
Technically speaking It is the field of study that gives computers the ability to learn from past data and find some meaningful conclusions patterns without being explicitly programmed,1,0,0.9999990000010001,0.035714284438775556,28,28.57142857142857,85.02857142857142,28,9,28,55,0,5.607142857142857
This statement needs some elaboration,0,0,0.0,0.0,5,40.0,30.8,5,2,5,14,0,6.6
The essence of ML is related to the process of Generalization and learning from past data,0,0,0.0,0.0,16,18.75,43.1,16,4,16,29,0,4.625
Generalization is an abstraction by which common properties of specific instances are formulated as general concepts or claims,0,0,0.0,0.0,18,22.22222222222222,59.28888888888889,18,7,18,42,0,6.055555555555555
Consider how we humans recognize daily life objects,0,0,0.0,0.0,8,25.0,30.400000000000002,8,2,8,17,1,5.5
If we see an animal then we can easily recognize if it is a dog or a cat,0,0,0.0,0.0,18,16.666666666666664,35.46666666666666,18,3,18,26,2,3.0555555555555554
It is a very trivial task for us but have you ever wondered how our mind is able to do it,0,1,-0.9999990000010001,0.04761904535147403,21,4.761904761904762,37.50476190476191,21,2,21,30,2,3.2857142857142856
The answer is Generalization,0,0,0.0,0.0,4,25.0,21.200000000000003,4,1,4,11,0,6.25
If you were given a picture of a dog you can easily recognize that it is a picture of a dog because our minds have abstracted the description of a dog and formulated it into a concept of what a dog is and these concepts became better and better as we learned from the past experiences of a dog,2,0,0.99999950000025,0.03389830451019823,59,11.864406779661017,121.9457627118644,59,11,59,99,2,3.983050847457627
So the way we think is dependent on the fact that things are represented as generalized concepts in our minds,0,0,0.0,0.0,20,5.0,45.6,20,3,20,32,2,4.5
With generalization only can come real information,0,0,0.0,0.0,7,28.57142857142857,31.42857142857143,7,2,7,19,0,6.285714285714286
So we try to give computers the ability to generalize the raw data and convert it into information which can be patterns and trends in the data on their own,0,0,0.0,0.0,30,13.333333333333334,67.73333333333333,30,4,30,48,1,4.233333333333333
Statistics This is the discipline that concerns the collection organization analysis interpretation and presentation of data,0,1,-0.9999990000010001,0.06249999609375024,16,43.75,67.10000000000001,16,7,16,42,0,6.8125
Statistics tries to deal with data with the only aim that is to explain it,0,0,0.0,0.0,15,13.333333333333334,34.93333333333333,15,2,15,23,0,4.0
So it is the study of explaining the data itself,0,0,0.0,0.0,10,10.0,23.200000000000003,10,1,10,15,0,3.9
Statistics has two main domains which are Descriptive statistics and Inferential statistics,0,0,0.0,0.0,12,50.0,56.400000000000006,12,6,12,29,0,6.666666666666667
Descriptive statistics deals with the explanation or description of data thus the name Descriptive statistics,0,0,0.0,0.0,15,40.0,59.6,15,6,15,35,0,6.333333333333333
It tries to explain as much information as possible easily about the whole large data which would be a very complex task otherwise,0,1,-0.9999990000010001,0.04347825897920613,23,26.08695652173913,62.434782608695656,23,6,23,44,0,4.695652173913044
Inferential statistics try to make accurate inferences from the available small data,2,0,0.99999950000025,0.16666665277777895,12,33.33333333333333,46.93333333333334,12,5,12,29,0,6.083333333333333
We use inference in many tasks in our daily lives,0,0,0.0,0.0,10,10.0,23.6,10,1,10,17,2,4.0
Consider a simple case of cooking a soup,0,0,0.0,0.0,8,25.0,26.0,8,2,8,15,0,4.125
After completing the recipe you will taste a small sample that is a spoonful of the soup to check if the soup tastes good or bad,1,1,0.0,0.07692307396449716,26,11.538461538461538,55.81538461538462,26,3,26,40,0,3.9615384615384617
Depending upon the result of the sample you make an inference about the whole soup that if the soup as a whole good or bad,1,1,0.0,0.07999999680000013,25,12.0,53.6,25,3,25,42,0,3.92
Similarly in statistics there are cases where you have to apply inference to have meaningful information,1,0,0.9999990000010001,0.06249999609375024,16,31.25,54.1,16,5,16,37,0,5.5625
For example consider a case where you cannot gather the whole data because it is very time-consuming and costly,0,2,-0.99999950000025,0.09999999500000024,20,20.0,52.400000000000006,20,4,20,37,0,4.65
In these cases applying inference based on the available sample introduces uncertainty,1,0,0.9999990000010001,0.08333332638888948,12,25.0,44.400000000000006,12,4,12,30,0,6.25
That is where inferential statistics come for help,0,0,0.0,0.0,8,25.0,30.0,8,2,8,16,0,5.375
So the use of data in the context of uncertainty and decision-making in the face of uncertainty is what statistics deals with,0,0,0.0,0.0,22,18.181818181818183,57.27272727272728,22,4,22,40,0,4.7272727272727275
So however and whatever the data statistics tries to explain that data,0,0,0.0,0.0,12,33.33333333333333,41.333333333333336,12,4,12,23,0,4.916666666666667
This aim does not resonate with that of AI and ML but statistics help these fields to correctly interpret the data,1,0,0.9999990000010001,0.04761904535147403,21,14.285714285714285,51.31428571428572,21,3,21,34,0,4.476190476190476
Data Mining Data is not useful at all in its raw form,1,0,0.9999990000010001,0.08333332638888948,12,8.333333333333332,24.53333333333333,12,1,12,17,0,3.5
Consider examples of sensors used in industrial applications,0,0,0.0,0.0,8,37.5,39.0,8,4,8,21,0,6.625
These sensors might be used in a manufacturing plant to sense different properties like temperature pressure etc,1,0,0.9999990000010001,0.05882352595155729,17,23.52941176470588,54.21176470588236,17,5,17,37,0,5.647058823529412
The raw data generated by these sensors are not useful until and unless it is converted to a suitable form then processed analyzed to gather valuable insights which can be used to solve a problem,3,1,0.49999987500003124,0.11428571102040827,35,8.571428571428571,81.42857142857144,35,7,35,62,0,4.6
Due to its unique aim of capturing the essence of very large datasets to gather insights Data Mining is also referred to as Knowledge Discovery,0,0,0.0,0.0,25,24.0,66.8,25,7,25,48,0,4.76
That is why Carly Fiorina former CEO of Hewlett-Packard once said The goal is to turn data into information and information into Insight,0,0,0.0,0.0,23,17.391304347826086,61.35652173913044,23,4,23,45,0,4.956521739130435
This statement completely explains the aim of Data Mining,0,0,0.0,0.0,9,33.33333333333333,36.13333333333333,9,3,9,18,0,5.444444444444445
So the difference between AI Machine Learning Statistics and Data Mining lies in their aims,0,1,-0.9999990000010001,0.06666666222222252,15,33.33333333333333,49.733333333333334,15,5,15,32,0,5.133333333333334
But the approaches taken in all of these fields help in one way or the other in fulfilling the aims of the other fields,0,0,0.0,0.0,24,4.166666666666666,49.26666666666667,24,2,24,37,0,4.0

An idea of this concept would be an awareness in beings of their surroundings themselves and their own perception,0,0,0.0,0.0,19,21.052631578947366,53.62105263157895,19,5,19,37,0,5.0
The reason this part of our mind remains unascertained is that consciousness isnt observable unlike brain matter that is studied scientifically,0,0,0.0,0.0,21,28.57142857142857,68.62857142857142,21,8,21,48,1,5.857142857142857
the physical clarification of awareness is in a general sense incomplete it doesnt include what it feels to be the subject for the subject,0,1,-0.9999990000010001,0.041666664930555625,24,20.833333333333336,63.53333333333334,24,5,24,45,0,4.791666666666667
There likewise is by all accounts an unbridgeable illustrative gap between the physical world and our consciousness,0,0,0.0,0.0,17,35.294117647058826,60.117647058823536,17,6,17,38,1,5.823529411764706

Whilst we have made tremendous progress in understanding brain activity over the years this research hasnt been able to answer all the questions relating to the nature of emotions and experiences,1,0,0.9999990000010001,0.032258063475546335,31,25.806451612903224,88.3225806451613,31,9,31,64,1,5.32258064516129
History Beginning within the late nineteenth century this was a time that once had psychological queries driven by a philosophical understanding of the mind which was typically equated with consciousness,0,0,0.0,0.0,30,20.0,89.2,30,8,30,62,0,5.8
As a result the analysis of brain and behavior naturally thought of the role of consciousness in behavioral management by the brain,0,0,0.0,0.0,22,27.27272727272727,63.30909090909091,22,6,22,44,0,5.0

Since consciousness incorporates stimuli from nature as well as interior stimuli the Mayans trusted it to be the most essential type of existence equipped for evolution,2,0,0.99999950000025,0.07692307396449716,26,30.76923076923077,79.50769230769231,26,10,26,59,0,5.5
The Incas however thought about consciousness as a movement of mindfulness as well as of worry for others too,1,1,0.0,0.10526315235457093,19,26.31578947368421,54.12631578947369,19,5,19,35,0,4.7894736842105265
John Locke an early philosopher said that consciousness and so individuality are freelanced of all substances,0,0,0.0,0.0,16,18.75,51.1,16,5,16,37,0,5.875
He also detected that there is no reason to believe that consciousness is stuck to any specific body or mind or that consciousness cannot be transferred from one body or mind to a different one,0,1,-0.9999990000010001,0.027777777006172864,36,16.666666666666664,83.86666666666667,36,8,36,61,0,4.416666666666667
Karl Marx another early thinker denies the mind-body classification and holds that consciousness is jeopardized by the material eventualities of ones settings,0,1,-0.9999990000010001,0.045454543388429844,22,18.181818181818183,70.47272727272728,22,7,22,52,0,6.2272727272727275
William James an American psychologist differentiated consciousness to a stream unbroken and continuous despite several changes and shifts,0,0,0.0,0.0,18,44.44444444444444,72.97777777777779,18,9,18,47,0,6.722222222222222
While the main center of a lot of the analysis moved to strictly note cable behaviors throughout the primary half of the twentieth century analysis of human consciousness has grown staggeringly after the 1950s,0,1,-0.9999990000010001,0.02941176384083048,34,20.588235294117645,91.83529411764707,34,7,34,61,0,5.176470588235294
In Sigmund Freuds psychoanalytic theory we can see that he believed that all three levels of awareness- preconscious conscious and unconscious were responsible for ones behavior and thinking,0,0,0.0,0.0,28,25.0,86.0,28,8,28,63,1,5.821428571428571
He believed that the mid itself was divided into three parts- the id the ego and the superego,0,0,0.0,0.0,18,5.555555555555555,39.422222222222224,18,3,18,30,0,4.222222222222222
The Id is present at birth instinctual and operates according to the pleasure principle,1,0,0.9999990000010001,0.07142856632653098,14,28.57142857142857,46.22857142857143,14,5,14,28,0,5.285714285714286
The ego underseals reality and logic and develops out of the id in infancy,0,0,0.0,0.0,14,21.428571428571427,38.17142857142857,14,3,14,25,0,4.357142857142857
Finally the superego is an internalization of societys moral standards and responsible for guilt,0,1,-0.9999990000010001,0.07142856632653098,14,28.57142857142857,49.82857142857143,14,4,14,32,0,5.928571428571429
Now the Id is regarded as unconscious whereas the ego and superego are also conscious and preconscious,0,0,0.0,0.0,17,29.411764705882355,52.56470588235294,17,6,17,38,0,5.0588235294117645
Freud constantly revised his own clinical qualities researches however and didnt conduct scientific experiments and hence his work is heavily scrutinized leaving the questions unanswered,1,0,0.9999990000010001,0.03999999840000006,25,28.000000000000004,85.60000000000001,25,12,25,61,0,6.48
Sigmund Freuds theory differed from the other psychologists since his theories were more understandable and very easily conveyed to the people,1,0,0.9999990000010001,0.04761904535147403,21,19.047619047619047,64.41904761904762,21,7,21,45,0,5.809523809523809

However his theories were subject to considerable criticism both now and during his own life,0,1,-0.9999990000010001,0.06666666222222252,15,20.0,44.800000000000004,15,4,15,30,0,5.2
Whilst John Locke and William James took a more practical approach to the mystery by conducting experiments Sigmund Freud didnt provide any evidence to support his claims,1,1,0.0,0.07407407133058995,27,25.925925925925924,78.37037037037038,27,7,27,50,0,5.333333333333333
Brain Today the essential focal point of consciousness research is on understanding what consciousness implies both biologically and mentally,0,0,0.0,0.0,19,31.57894736842105,69.03157894736842,19,7,19,46,0,6.473684210526316
Issues of interest include phenomena such as perception blindsight brainwaves during sleep and altered states of consciousness produced by psychoactive drugs,0,1,-0.9999990000010001,0.04761904535147403,21,28.57142857142857,74.22857142857143,21,10,21,50,0,6.523809523809524
A greater part of the test assesses consciousness by approaching human subjects for a verbal report of their encounters,0,0,0.0,0.0,19,21.052631578947366,56.021052631578954,19,5,19,37,0,5.315789473684211
However to confirm the criticalness of these verbal reports researchers must contrast them with the action that all the while happens in the brain that is they should search for the neural connections of consciousness,0,0,0.0,0.0,35,20.0,94.80000000000001,35,7,35,64,0,5.228571428571429
Hope is to locate that noticeable action in a specific aspect of the brain or a particular pattern of global brain activity will be greatly predictive of consciousness mindfulness,0,0,0.0,0.0,29,31.03448275862069,84.01379310344828,29,9,29,60,0,5.206896551724138

A few investigations have shown that movement in essential primary sensory areas of the brain isnt adequate to create consciousness it is workable for subjects to report an absence of awareness in any event when areas for example the primary visual cortex show clear electrical reactions to a stimulus,3,1,0.49999987500003124,0.08163265139525201,49,32.6530612244898,133.46122448979594,49,16,49,102,0,5.163265306122449
Higher brain areas are viewed as all the more encouraging particularly the prefrontal cortex which is involved in a range of high order functions,1,0,0.9999990000010001,0.041666664930555625,24,20.833333333333336,66.33333333333334,24,7,24,48,0,5.083333333333333

The four types of brain waves alpha beta theta and delta each correspond with one mental state relaxed alert lightly asleep and deeply asleep Memory Episodic memory can be regarded as the only form of conscious memory,1,0,0.9999990000010001,0.027027026296566857,37,13.513513513513514,92.20540540540541,37,7,37,69,0,4.891891891891892
This is because it is the capacity to consciously remember personally experienced events and situations in the past,0,0,0.0,0.0,18,33.33333333333333,59.33333333333333,18,7,18,39,0,5.444444444444445

Consciousness also plays a part in important memory distinctions,1,0,0.9999990000010001,0.11111109876543349,9,33.33333333333333,38.93333333333334,9,3,9,20,0,6.222222222222222
One such distinction is the implicit and explicit characteristics; in which explicit memory is what you consciously know and implicit memory includes events you may not be conscious of,1,0,0.9999990000010001,0.033333332222222255,30,26.666666666666668,84.26666666666667,30,9,30,58,0,5.2
Furthermore several empirical findings suggest that declarative memory is related to consciousness as well; meaning that the retrieval and formation of this memory are connected to awareness,1,0,0.9999990000010001,0.035714284438775556,28,32.142857142857146,88.85714285714286,28,11,28,63,0,5.857142857142857
Working memory operates/maintains consciously perceived information as well since it temporarily stores and tampers with information whilst working on tasks,1,0,0.9999990000010001,0.04999999750000012,20,25.0,72.4,20,6,20,50,0,6.85

PET and fMRI have temporal resolution problems EEG is well-known to have localizability difficulties and implanted electrodes whilst great in temporal and spatial resolution can only test a set number of neurons; that is they are restricted in scope,2,3,-0.199999960000008,0.12499999687500009,40,17.5,106.60000000000001,40,11,40,80,0,5.275

As we can observe from neural examinations of the brain to detect the causes of consciousness there is no sensory sector of the brain that is the cause for one to be aware during a certain event even if there are clear signs of a reaction to a stimulus,1,0,0.9999990000010001,0.020408162848813003,49,18.367346938775512,108.14693877551022,49,10,49,88,1,4.163265306122449

All this idea for Colonizing in outer space emerged when NASA was able to launch a space shuttle with a heavy payload in the late 1990s this idea didnt stir brain at that time but later was like apple eyes when various articles from astronauts and their writeup came into limelight and this idea saw its progression space exploration was not a new normal companies were petrified by the number of investments that these kinds of projects ask for,1,1,0.0,0.025316455375741072,79,16.455696202531644,184.58227848101268,79,17,79,142,0,4.6455696202531644

Now being in 2020 we do not find it out of a place of colonizing outside of space the kind of emergence of technologies has led to the escalation of spreading the roots of human existence the plan for reaching out to outer space too plays a key role for this idea too,1,0,0.9999990000010001,0.01886792417230332,53,16.9811320754717,113.59245283018868,53,10,53,91,1,4.056603773584905
Proper Planning Analysing Organising and Executing were required for these projects to be successful for deeper know how I would like to mention here an example of Space X According to them they wud be successful for sending Rockets by 2022 and would able to colonize by 2050 For achieving these vision they have planned a total of 36 times pre-launch of the same rocket which they will be launching by 2020,4,0,0.9999997500000625,0.05555555478395063,72,19.444444444444446,170.57777777777778,72,15,72,119,1,4.666666666666667

But the fundamental change that people have to undergo while living on another planet will be a change in gravity and being able to be near to live support if any technical issues arise to their suit until unless we find a similar place like the earth that is the change which humans have to adjust,2,1,0.33333322222225925,0.05357142761479594,56,12.5,124.2,56,8,56,96,1,4.339285714285714
Aspects like Ultraviolet rays too will play an immense role in the survival but with the rate of technology expanding and challenging at very boundaries there are not many days left when we find solutions to these aspects but this idea of colonizing has more to do with monetary terms it has been projected that building a colony at space will cost at about $10 Trillian which is more than many countries GDP,3,1,0.49999987500003124,0.05405405332359388,74,17.56756756756757,170.22702702702702,74,16,74,124,1,4.54054054054054

Though all these skills we have but its would not sufficient to make us a great leader because to excel and utilize these abilities in practice we need a lot of technical expertise in a particular domain,3,0,0.9999996666667778,0.08108107888970058,37,24.324324324324326,90.92972972972973,37,10,37,73,3,4.513513513513513
For example Like in a hospital if the head of the hospital is lead by other people rather than Doctor then the hospital would become worse at a point because the person from other fields he could not lead and understand the real scenario and mechanism that the hospital is functioning and he would not understand the staff and the patient as well,5,1,0.6666665555555741,0.09523809372637947,63,22.22222222222222,147.2888888888889,63,14,63,109,0,4.507936507936508

Financial Crisis Explained In the year 1996 there was a dot-com boom or otherwise known as the dot com bubble in the United States a period of massive growth in the use of the internet because of which the stock market prices started increasing rapidly,1,1,0.0,0.04444444345679015,45,15.555555555555555,107.02222222222223,45,9,45,79,0,4.622222222222222
However around the year 2000 it dropped which led people and investors to withdraw their investments from the stock market rapidly,1,0,0.9999990000010001,0.04761904535147403,21,23.809523809523807,61.52380952380952,21,5,21,36,0,5.238095238095238
It led to the decline of the price of shares in stock markets and the interest rate plummeted to around 1% very quickly in a short span,1,1,0.0,0.07142856887755111,28,10.714285714285714,58.28571428571429,28,4,28,39,0,3.892857142857143

Fig Rise and fall of the Dot Com Bubble As interest rates went lower and lower real estate prices started rising and the US Govt also encouraged people to buy houses and properties,0,1,-0.9999990000010001,0.030303029384756687,33,9.090909090909092,75.63636363636364,33,6,33,58,1,4.484848484848484

During that same time Investment Banks saw an opportunity chimed in and started buying loans from Banks in bulk and clubbed multiple loans under a complex derivative called CDO Collateralized Debt Obligations and started providing it to these Investors after getting a credit rating of AAA Very Safe Investment from the Credit Rating Agencies,1,2,-0.33333322222225925,0.05555555452674899,54,16.666666666666664,143.46666666666667,54,11,54,106,0,5.351851851851852

Approximately $174Bn worth of loans were given out during the period 2000-2007 and most of them were clubbed as CDOs with a AAA rating from the Credit Rating Agencies,1,0,0.9999990000010001,0.033333332222222255,30,10.0,70.4,30,4,30,48,0,4.6

Looking at the huge profits being made by the Investment Banks and Credit Rating Agencies Insurance companies like AIG now started giving out insurance on these CDOs to the investors and they called it CDS Credit Default Swap,1,0,0.9999990000010001,0.026315788781163457,38,15.789473684210526,96.31578947368422,38,8,38,70,0,4.947368421052632
AIG believed that since the CDOs were rated as AAA Very Safe Investment the failure chances of these CDOs were very minimal,1,1,0.0,0.09090908677685969,22,18.181818181818183,56.472727272727276,22,5,22,42,0,4.636363636363637

Now CDO Investors started buying out CDS from AIG and other companies to safeguard and protect them from any losses,1,1,0.0,0.09999999500000024,20,10.0,50.0,20,3,20,34,0,4.8

Fig Flow Diagram showing how the Risk Factors got transferred Coming to the loan borrowers now Sub Prime Borrowers from banks were unaware of the fact of Adjustable Rate Loans interest rate of these loans keeps changing and thus had to pay lower interests at the start but more interest rates later on,2,1,0.33333322222225925,0.056603772516909956,53,15.09433962264151,126.4377358490566,53,9,53,90,0,4.69811320754717
The borrowers started defaulting on these loans when the interest rates increased dramatically around 2007 and thus banks had to then resell those houses to make up for the loans defaulted,0,0,0.0,0.0,31,16.129032258064516,81.65161290322581,31,8,31,58,0,5.096774193548387
Added to the problem was the fact that borrowers were not spending any amount of money from their pockets while taking loans and banks were providing the full amount of loans,0,1,-0.9999990000010001,0.032258063475546335,31,12.903225806451612,74.76129032258065,31,4,31,51,0,4.645161290322581

This led to a huge increase in the defaulters of borrowers and ultimately banks had to auction houses to gain credit back,2,0,0.99999950000025,0.09090908677685969,22,22.727272727272727,57.49090909090909,22,6,22,41,0,4.545454545454546

The prices of Real Estate started falling drastically and people with good credit scores who had earlier taken housing loans also started defaulting because the price of their houses/homes fell below the loan amount that they had taken earlier,1,3,-0.49999987500003124,0.10256409993425386,39,23.076923076923077,106.43076923076924,39,10,39,81,0,5.256410256410256

Effective strategies include educating gamers about gaming behaviors and consequences on their mental health; treatment geared towards helping the gamer to control his/her urge for video games recognizing and dealing with disturbing thoughts and learning how to cope without video games; intrapersonal and interpersonal counseling to help gamers to explore their identity build self-esteem and enhance their emotional intelligence outside the fictional world of gaming and learning communication and assertiveness skills needed in social interactions; family involvement including counseling and discussion family and other relationships; and developing new lifestyles,4,2,0.33333327777778704,0.06451612833853626,93,37.634408602150536,282.2537634408602,93,40,93,224,0,6.236559139784946

Though situations are improving now and the lockdowns are being lifted it is a fact that it cannot be shunned that this virus will have a long term impact on people and the effects will not only be felt economically and physically but also mentally,1,2,-0.33333322222225925,0.06521738988657848,46,8.695652173913043,102.67826086956524,46,4,46,72,0,4.434782608695652

This means that social distancing will also have to be followed in offices; where it will be a problem to do so because of the lack of adequate infrastructure and space,1,2,-0.33333322222225925,0.0937499970703126,32,15.625,73.45,32,7,32,56,0,4.3125

However these problems are quite obvious though people havent thought about them much but the fact which people fail to notice and understand is that the meaning of space is not only limited to infrastructural space which is measured in square foot or square meters; but it also extends to metal space or for that fact space in the minds of people for others and their thoughts as well as opinions,1,3,-0.49999987500003124,0.05555555478395063,72,19.444444444444446,166.57777777777778,72,16,72,127,0,4.541666666666667

The problem doesnt arise when such a situation happens wherein an employee is getting paid more than the other but instead it arises when people start to compare their earnings as well as benefits to that of others,2,1,0.33333322222225925,0.07894736634349037,38,23.684210526315788,95.07368421052632,38,10,38,70,0,4.657894736842105

Since there will exist inequalities and partialities in companies there will also exist a sense of hatred and competition among the employees of the same company; who will compete to get a better position or a raise in their salary,1,2,-0.33333322222225925,0.07317072992266513,41,9.75609756097561,96.30243902439025,41,8,41,82,0,4.682926829268292

Another kind of industry and companies that will be affected due to the long-lasting impact of COVID 19 is the co-working industry and offices,1,0,0.9999990000010001,0.041666664930555625,24,12.5,61.800000000000004,24,6,24,41,0,4.958333333333333

Because of this employees will be told by the company owners to exploit the resources present in the offices and use them to the fullest; to compensate for the losses being born and to make better use of the money being used,1,2,-0.33333322222225925,0.06976744023796651,43,6.976744186046512,92.39069767441862,43,6,43,70,0,4.255813953488372
However the number of resources will be the same and so there will be a case of competition between employees of different companies to use resources and take benefits of the same,1,0,0.9999990000010001,0.031249999023437534,32,15.625,77.85000000000001,32,9,32,63,0,4.625

The three categories usually follow such trends Demand Trends during & post a Pandemic-generated Crisis 4 Demand Trends during & post a Pandemic-generated Crisis 4 Demand Trends during & post a Pandemic-generated Crisis[1] These three trends are a valuable tool for both large scale players and regional retailers who now have the means to prioritize and predict consumer-demand and consequently alleviate a sudden strain on the product supply chain arising out of sudden & unexpected demands,1,5,-0.6666665555555741,0.07594936612722322,79,11.39240506329114,201.35696202531648,79,14,79,151,0,5.2784810126582276
Change in Consumer Behaviour A peculiar outcome of such epidemics have been the somewhat permanent changes instilled in consumer buying trends across the inflicted regions across product categories Fresh staples see a sharp rise in their demand and product hygiene & safety standards are ranked higher up in the consumers priority list,2,1,0.33333322222225925,0.05769230658284026,52,23.076923076923077,143.23076923076925,52,15,52,107,0,5.461538461538462

In the words of Johan Neyts professor of virology and president of the Belgian-based International Society for Antiviral Research ISAR health authorities failed to incorporate the learnings of the SARS outbreak of the early 2000s partly because of the economic crisis of 2008 which squeezed funds from any potential research that could have been undertaken and partly because of the lack of seriousness in authorities in considering the efforts involved in dealing with the future expected breaks of coronavirus due to its seven different strains in existence,0,6,-0.9999998333333611,0.06896551644867223,87,26.436781609195403,234.17471264367816,87,30,87,185,0,5.436781609195402

Hillary Clinton aimed to do just that when she got the Billboard-topping artists Beyonce and Jay-Z to take center-stage at her rally in Cleveland in the weeks leading up to the 2016 US presidential elections in fact as multiple sources suggest this rally did see a surge in millennial supporters,1,0,0.9999990000010001,0.01999999960000001,50,20.0,126.0,50,12,50,88,1,4.92

This case even exacerbates when the team did not work on the feedback mechanism and hence was not able to change customer perception about Nano,1,0,0.9999990000010001,0.03999999840000006,25,20.0,65.2,25,6,25,47,0,4.76

Though there are many potential use cases for Cryptocurrencies and the Indian Government is very critical about implementing the technology in banking and finance it still has a lot of issues to be resolved before we can commercially use it for transactions,0,2,-0.99999950000025,0.0476190464852608,42,26.190476190476193,113.2761904761905,42,14,42,83,1,5.142857142857143
Some of the most important drawbacks of Cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin right now are as below ScalabilityBitcoin can have <7 transactions per second as compared to ~47000 via payment network giants like VisaThere is a block limit of 1MB which amounts to 8GBs per 10 min on a Bitcoin block to match 47000 transactions per second,4,2,0.33333327777778704,0.10714285522959188,56,14.285714285714285,136.11428571428573,56,10,56,92,0,4.857142857142857
This essentially means that home computers cannot process this currently and it has very limited use cases with transactions requiring devices having the high computational powerCentralizationHigh computation power requirement would limit the usage of the network to only those who can afford itThis will eventually lead to fewer validations for the Distributed Ledger defeating the whole purpose of using Blockchain,3,2,0.199999960000008,0.08196721177102932,61,22.950819672131146,175.58032786885246,61,17,61,135,0,5.852459016393443
A distributed ledger means that everyone in the network can validate the transaction between two parties So it becomes important to have a cheaply available validation mechanism that can be carried out using a basic broadband connection in-home/small business computers,2,1,0.33333322222225925,0.07499999812500005,40,32.5,120.60000000000001,40,17,40,92,0,5.75

They can conduct an unlimited number of transactions on this channel and finally when one party closes the channel the balances will be added to the blockchain,1,0,0.9999990000010001,0.037037035665294975,27,7.4074074074074066,66.56296296296297,27,4,27,45,0,4.925925925925926
Each user can open a digital wallet to store Bitcoins and deposit some coins in it once the channel is opened this money is kind of a security deposit on behalf of both the parties to honor their transactionOnce they need to exchange money after their books are updated they can sign off the ledger in the channelFinally this will be added to the blockchain once the channel is closed The network is globally scalable since to reach any person through connected channels network you just need to know the path to connect to that person through leveraging your existing network,1,0,0.9999990000010001,0.009900990000980298,101,11.881188118811881,235.15247524752476,101,16,101,177,0,4.712871287128713
